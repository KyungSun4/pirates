# pirates
a multiplayer online game made by KyungSun4 and MightyKhan using node.js and socket.io.
Graphics by MightyKhan and code by KyungSun4
# How the game works
Players can join on both desktop and molile devices through their web browser, both touchscreen and mouse and keyboard controls are supported.
Players then purchase and upgrade ships in order to attack and destroy enemy ships which then drop coins to allow the attackers to further upgrade their ships. Ships have a variety of attributes and special abilities. Some ships are capble of supporting planes and helicopters.
Ships can also be assigned different tasks. They may be assigned to shoot at the direction of the mouse pointer or target ships on their own either based on size, health, or porximity.
# Future Updates
As the development of this game progresses the attributes of ships will be updated, graphics will be refined and 2 more game modes are planed.
Future game modes are: Capture the flag, and island capture.
In capture the flag players would randomly be assigned to two teams which would work together to reach the oposing teams flag and return in to their home island.
In island capture teams would work together to maintain control of islands by keeping thier own ships within a dictated proximity to each island. The goal of this game would be for a team to control as many islands as possible.
